# Operating Systems Assignments

This repository contains assignments for an operating systems course. Below is a brief description of each task along with links to detailed README files.

## [shellOps](github.com/DorHarizi/Operating_Systems_Assignments/Task1_ShellOps)
This task involves operations in the shell. Here, various shell scripting techniques and command-line utilities are explored and utilized to perform specific operations or solve particular problems. [More details](./shellOps/README.md)

## [ipc](./ipc/README.md)
IPC (Inter-Process Communication) is the focus of this task. It deals with methods and mechanisms that allow processes to communicate and synchronize with each other, such as pipes, message queues, and shared memory. [More details](./ipc/README.md)

## [Chatting using DP Reactor](./ChattingUsingDPReactor/README.md)
This assignment is about creating a chat application using the Design Patterns (DP) Reactor. The Reactor pattern is used to handle service requests that are delivered concurrently to an application by one or more clients. [More details](./ChattingUsingDPReactor/README.md)

## [DP Active Object](./DPActiveObject/README.md)
In this task, the Active Object design pattern is implemented. This pattern decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. [More details](./DPActiveObject/README.md)
