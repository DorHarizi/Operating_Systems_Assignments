# My Operating Systems Projects

Welcome to my repository of Operating Systems projects! This repository contains four different projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects and concepts of operating systems, demonstrating my progression and skills in the subject. Below you will find a brief overview of each project. For a more detailed explanation, including the concepts used and what each project entails, please refer to the individual README.md file within each project's directory.

## 1. [Shell Operations (shellOps)](./Task1_ShellOps)

In this project, various shell operations are performed to gain a practical understanding of the Linux shell environment and scripting basics.
